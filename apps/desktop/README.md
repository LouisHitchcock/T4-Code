# Desktop

CUT3 desktop wraps the web UI in Electron and starts a desktop-scoped `t3` backend on loopback. The renderer still talks to the same WebSocket and orchestration surface as the browser app, while the Electron main process owns native dialogs, desktop secrets, menus, backend lifecycle, and update UX.

## Key files

- `src/main.ts` wires startup, backend spawn and restart behavior, protocol registration, menu actions, IPC handlers, and update state.
- `src/preload.ts` exposes `window.desktopBridge`, including the WebSocket URL handoff, update actions, native dialogs, and secrets APIs.
- `src/preloadWsUrl.ts` resolves the initial backend WebSocket URL from the environment or command-line arguments.
- `scripts/dev-electron.mjs` launches the desktop shell in development.
- `scripts/start-electron.mjs` launches the built desktop shell locally.
- `scripts/smoke-test.mjs` verifies that a built Electron app launches, reaches backend readiness, and avoids obvious startup crashes.

## Startup sequence

1. `app.whenReady()` runs in `src/main.ts`.
2. Electron registers IPC handlers and generates a desktop backend auth token.
3. Electron spawns the bundled `apps/server/dist` entry with `CUT3_MODE=desktop`, `CUT3_PORT=0`, and `CUT3_AUTH_TOKEN`.
4. The backend emits a readiness line prefixed with `[cut3-desktop-ready]` once it has selected a loopback port.
5. Electron converts that port into a renderer-safe WebSocket URL and broadcasts it through `desktopBridge.onBackendWsUrlUpdated`.
6. The main window loads either the Vite dev server or the packaged `cut3://app/index.html` document.

## Development and local launch

- From the repo root, use `bun run dev:desktop` for the normal desktop development flow.
- From `apps/desktop`, use `bun run dev` if you only want the Electron package-local workflow.
- To launch the built desktop app locally, run `bun run start:desktop` from the repo root or `bun run start` inside `apps/desktop` after building.

## State and logs

- Desktop state defaults to `CUT3_STATE_DIR` when it is set.
- Without an override, desktop state lives under `~/.t3/cut3`.
- Packaged builds capture main-process logs in `<state-dir>/logs/desktop-main.log` and backend child logs in `<state-dir>/logs/server-child.log`.
- Development launches forward main-process bootstrap headers plus backend stdout and stderr to the parent terminal instead of rotating packaged log files.

## Release workflow notes

- On Windows, the repo-root `build-windows-installer.bat` wrapper runs the standard `bun run dist:desktop:win` packaging flow and writes artifacts into `./release`.
- The release workflow builds `apps/desktop/dist-electron` plus `apps/server/dist` once in Linux preflight, archives that bundle, and reuses it in each packaging job via `bun run dist:desktop:artifact -- --skip-build`.
- Release assets are published for all supported desktop targets from one tag: macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64, and Windows x64.
- The workflow always publishes `SHA256SUMS` for the final release assets.
- macOS and Windows signing remain secret-driven, and releases can be configured to fail instead of silently shipping unsigned installers by enabling `CUT3_REQUIRE_SIGNING=true` (or the matching manual workflow input).
- Manual release workflow runs also support `dry_run=true`, which validates packaging/signing/checksum steps and uploads the assembled assets as a workflow artifact without publishing a GitHub Release or updating `main`.

## Smoke test contract

- Run `bun run test:desktop-smoke` from the repo root or `bun run smoke-test` inside `apps/desktop`.
- The smoke test launches `dist-electron/main.js`, waits for the `[cut3-desktop-ready]{...}` backend readiness marker, and fails on launch-time fatal errors.
- The smoke test does not validate full renderer interaction, menu behavior, or update installation.
